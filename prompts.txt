To recreate the hero section of the provided website image, follow this detailed design specification:

**Layout and Structure:**
1. The hero section is a full viewport width and height container with a dark background color.
2. The top left corner features a logo.
3. The top right corner has a hamburger menu icon, indicating a collapsible menu.
4. The main headline "DIGITAL DESIGNER & ART DIRECTOR." is prominently displayed in large, light-colored text aligned to the left.
5. A sub-headline "BASED IN WARSAW, POLAND - UTC/GMT+2" is displayed below the main headline in smaller text.
6. A circular image of a person (Stefan) is aligned to the right side of the section; part of the image exceeds the right boundary of the section, creating an overlap effect.
7. To the left of the person's image, two distinct content blocks float:
    - The top block contains the text "Hi, I'm Stefan" and should be styled as a speech bubble.
    - The bottom block presents an achievement metric "12 Years of experience" and "100% Satisfied clients" together with associated icons.
8. The bottom part of the hero section contains two large buttons or clickable indicators labeled "Human-centered" and "Interactive".

**Styling:**
- Background: A linear gradient or solid color that contrasts well with light text.
- Logo and Menu Icon: Style according to brand guidelines, positioned in fixed corners.
- Main Headline: Use a large, bold font, set to a light color against the dark background.
- Sub-Headline: A lighter font-weight and smaller size than the main headline, same text color.
- Circle Image:
  - Positioned partly outside the section's right edge.
  - Should have a border, shadow, or other effects to make it stand out against the background.
- Content blocks (Speech bubble and Achievements):
  - A background color that contrasts with the main background.
  - Rounded corners.
  - Drop shadows to create depth.
- Bottom Buttons/Indicators:
  - Large text with strong visual indicators that they are interactive (hover effects, etc.).
  - Aligned horizontally, separated from each other and placed towards the lower section.

**Interactivity:**
- Hamburger Menu Icon: On click, should trigger an event to display a navigation menu (the functionality and specifics of the menu are beyond the scope of this hero section design).
- Bottom Buttons/Indicators: On hover, should change appearance (e.g., color change, elevation, or transparency) to indicate that they are actionable elements.

**Accessibility:**
- Ensure all text is legible and that the contrast ratio between text and background meets WCAG standards.
- Semantic HTML: Use appropriate tags like `<header>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<button>` for better accessibility and SEO.

**Technical Notes:**
- The overall layout can be achieved using CSS Flexbox or CSS Grid for positioning elements responsively.
- Use media queries to ensure the design is responsive and adjusts gracefully to different screen sizes.
- Use scalable units like `em`, `rem`, or percentages for font-sizes, paddings, and margins to maintain relative spacing and sizing on different devices.
- Employ modern CSS properties like `border-radius`, `box-shadow`, and `text-shadow` for stylistic details.
- Make sure the site is cross-browser compatible by using appropriate browser prefixes and fallbacks where necessary.
- For any animations or transitions, use CSS3 transitions or keyframe animations, and keep them subtle to prevent distractions.

Please note that font choices, exact colors, and other brand-specific design elements would need to be detailed in a complete design guide or style sheet which is not provided here. This specification aims to give a developer enough information to create a close approximation of the hero section with placeholders for specific design assets.
